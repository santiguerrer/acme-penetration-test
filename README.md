## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

- **Nmap**: Scanned the network for open ports and services.
- **Metasploit**: Used for exploitation testing and post-exploitation analysis.
- **Hydra**: Tested password strength by attempting brute-force login.
- **Burp Suite**: Analyzed the web application for security weaknesses.
- **Wireshark**: Captured and analyzed network traffic to find unencrypted data.

## üß™ Findings

### **SQL Injection**  
- **Severity**: Critical  
- **Description**: Exploited a vulnerable endpoint on the web server to bypass login authentication using SQL injection.  
- **Remediation**: Use prepared statements and proper input validation.

### **Outdated System**  
- **Severity**: Critical  
- **Description**: SQL Server 2012 is no longer supported, leaving it vulnerable to known exploits.  
- **Remediation**: Upgrade to a supported version of SQL Server.

### **Insufficient Data Encryption**  
- **Severity**: High  
- **Description**: Sensitive data (such as passwords) was transmitted in plaintext.  
- **Remediation**: Implement HTTPS and encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.

### **Weak Password Policy**  
- **Severity**: High  
- **Description**: Weak password policies and no multi-factor authentication.  
- **Remediation**: Enforce stronger password policies and implement multi-factor authentication.
